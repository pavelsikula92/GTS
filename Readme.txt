The Geometric Unification Theory (GTS) is an emergent gravity framework that treats the vacuum not as an empty stage, but as a dynamic Causal Substrate.
By modeling spacetime as a high-density hypergraph, GTS demonstrates that physical constants and gravitational behavior emerge from Topological Impedance ($Z_v$).
This repository contains the suite of simulation and validation tools used to process over 98,000 stellar objects, evidencing a systematic phase transition in high-stress causal environments where
General Relativity fails to account for observed redshift damping.

Core Physics Axioms

-The Forbidden Zone (Stability Plateau): Local spacetime ($5.0 < \chi < 13.5$) is anchored to a 3D Euclidean state, preserving General Relativity for Solar System scales.

-Topological Superconductivity: In high-stress regimes ($\chi > 14$), the Effective Dimension ($D_{eff}$) rises above 3.0, reducing vacuum resistance and modifying gravitational potential.

-Impedance Bridge ($Z_v$): The coupling between light propagation and gravitational flux is governed by substrate permeability.
